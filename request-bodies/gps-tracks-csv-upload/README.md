# TollTally - GPS Tracks CSV Upload

The `/gps-tracks-csv-upload` endpoint calculates toll information about a particular route using its GPS points uploaded as CSV file.

**NOTE:** The `/gps-tracks-csv-upload` endpoint takes in a CSV file as input. The JSON files present in this directory represent the query parameters that are sent in the URL along with the uploaded file. To make it easier to generate a request with these sample query parameters, we have provided utility scripts in the `scripts/` folder written for both Python and Node.js. For example, a `cURL` request for the `01-sync-upload-for-small-files.json` file can be generated by running `python scripts/convert_json_params_to_curl.py 01-sync-upload-for-small-files.json out.txt`
