# TollGuru API Endpoints

The TollGuru API includes multiple endpoints:

* [Origin-Destination-Cost-Tradeoff](./01-Origin-Destination-Cost-Tradeoff/): Retrieves route details, toll info, and fuel expenses given an origin, destination and in-between waypoints.
* [Complete-Polyline-to-Toll](./02-Complete-Polyline-To-Toll/): Calculates tolls for encoded polylines from an external mapping provider or TollGuru, eliminating the need for explicit start/endpoints.
* [TollTally-GPS-Track-to-Toll](./03-TollTally-GPS-Tracks-To-Toll/): Allows users to upload GPS tracking data to determine toll and fuel costs for specific routes.
